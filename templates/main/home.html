            <p class="section-text">
                Many IT and Computer Science students struggle to find local opportunities simply because
                they don’t know where nearby tech companies are located. Our platform solves this problem by
                creating a centralized community-based hub where students, professionals, and tech startups can
                finally connect and grow together.
